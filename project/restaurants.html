            <h1>Restaurants</h1>
            <p>Syracuse, NY has hundreds of restaurants for you to try. But, instead of you trying them, I tried some of them for you! I have identified what I think are restaurants with the best vibes and food in town. Ranging from a decadent meal to a fun night out with friends, each restaurant has its charm. Every weekend my friends and I make it a point to try out a new local eatery. I have long lists of places I would like to try next. If you think I am missing any, let me know! I hope all you foodies enjoy these Syracuse restaurants as much as I did.

            <h2>Rise & Shine</h2>
            <img src=../project/riseandshine.jpg alt="riseandshine">
            <p>Rise & Shine is my favorite breakfast place in Syracuse. Whenever I am home in Cleveland, I cannot wait to go back to Syracuse to go Rise & Shine. Rise & Shine offers both breakfast and brunch menu items. Be sure to call ahead because there is always an hour-long wait here. There are two different locations, but my favorite is in the Westcott area. The aesthetic of this diner is perfect. The yellow booths and glitter mimosas make it the perfect place to take pictures. If you like taking pictures of your food this is the place to go. Rise & Shine prides itself on its extravagant food presentations. Order a milkshake? Expect a piece of cake to come on top of it. Try the Tin Can Breakfast Perogies for something fun and tasty. My personal favorite is their newly released pancake flight that comes with birthday cake flavored pancakes, strawberries n’ cream pancakes, and s’mores pancakes. Go hungry to this one-of-a-kind breakfast location! </p>

            <h2>The York</h2>
            <img src=../project/yorkbar.jpg alt="theyork">
            <p>The York puts a modern twist on American cuisine. This upscale restaurant is perfect for a date night or dinner out with your friends. The atmosphere is that of a swanky restaurant and lounge in New York City. This niche restaurant provides an experience like no other restaurant I have been to in Syracuse. The decor is industrial-chic and makes you want to settle down with a nice drink in your hand. They have a rotating menu so your experience will be different each time. Upon arrival, guests are greeted with a boat of pickles instead of the traditional basket of bread. On the weekends, you will find tasteful live music to accompany your meal. My personal favorite item is the Salmon encrusted in everything seasoning served with lemon herb couscous and dill creme fraiche. Start your meal with the gorgonzola fondue. Any item on this menu you cannot go wrong with. The next time you're looking for a nice night out make this restaurant at the top of your list! </p>

        <div class="daises">
            <h2>Crazy Daisies</h2>
            <img src=../project/crazydaises.jpg alt="crazydaises">
            <p>I love Crazy Daisies! The name says it all. This family-run greenhouse and garden cafe makes amazing drinks and food. Order one of their seasonal flights for brunch or dinner. Whether it is Spring or Winter, their seasonal drink menu cannot be missed. Try one of their decadent charcuterie boards. I recommend getting the Bake Brie & Apples too! Charcuterie boards not for you? Opt for a wood-fired pizza. It is impossible to go wrong with any of their drink options. The best part of Crazy Daisies is the atmosphere. Sit and eat in the greenhouse or outside on picnic tables. Listen to live music on the weekends while enjoying a sunset over the property. Although it is a little bit of a drive out of Syracuse, it is definitely worth it! The staff was amazing. The owner's dog roamed free making for the perfect summer vibes. This is a very covid friendly restaurant that attracts friends, couples, and families. This is a must-try, especially during the summer and fall. </p>

        <div class="ohmydarling">
            <h2>Oh My Darling</h2>
            <img src=../project/speakeasy.jpg alt="ohmydarling">
            <p>“Oh, My Darling” you must try this restaurant located in the heart of Armory. Serving American comfort food, anyone can find a meal they will love here. Try the Rosemary Hot Honey Dipped Crispy Chicken. Looking for a meatless option? Try the Homemade Mac & Cheese. Looking to make a night of it? Checkout the speakeasy right below “Oh My Darling!” The Fitz is the perfect way to end your evening after enjoying a fantastic meal. The atmosphere of “Oh My Darling” is chic and modern restaurant perfect for date night or a night out with your visiting parents. The restaurant sources its food from local farmers whenever possible. The staff was very friendly and willing to accommodate a large group (pre-covid). I recommend checking the hours and table availability before going. This is definitely not a place to miss in the heart of downtown Syracuse. </p>
