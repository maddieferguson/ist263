            <p>Most college students drink beer and cheap alcohol. I like to be a bit more dignified with my choices in what I drink! Here are some of my go-to drink recipes for any night of the week. Most of my favorite drink recipes contain ingredients that almost all college students have in their apartment. When making drink recipes I try to keep in mind what is going to taste great and look really cool! As long as your drink responsibility, any of these drinks can ensure a fun night!

                    <ol>
                        <li> First, grab your Corona and take a nice long sip. Drink the beer until the level is even with the top of the label on the bottle. </li>
                        <li> Next, grab your tequila and fill it up to about where the bottle’s neck begins to narrow. Pour orange juice to the top of the bottle, leaving a little room for a splash of grenadine. </li>
                        <li> Add a splash of grenadine to make the Corona bottle completely full again. </li>
                        <li> Garnish with a wedge of lime and enjoy! This super easy drink requires very few ingredients and always hits the spot. Happy drinking! </li>

                    <ol>
                        <li> First, grab a glass and fill it to the brim with ice. This glass will be what you are drinking out of so pick accordingly. </li>
                        <li> Add two 1 ½ ounce shots of vodka. Any vodka works! Feeling adventurous? Opt to use a cherry flavored vodka. </li>
                        <li> Next, add three ounces of grenadine. Add more or less to taste. </li>
                        <li> Pour lemon-lime soda into the glass until it is full. Use your favorite brand of lemon-lime soda. I recommend Sprite, or 7UP. </li>
                        <li> Lastly, stir with a spoon or straw and garnish with a maraschino cherry. You have now reentered your childhood! Enjoy! </li>
