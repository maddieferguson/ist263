            <p>Most college students drink beer and cheap alcohol. I like to be a bit more dignified with my choices in what I drink! Here are some of my go-to drink recipes for any night of the week. Most of my favorite drink recipes contain ingredients that almost all college students have in their apartment. When making drink recipes I try to keep in mind what is going to taste great and look really cool! As long as your drink responsibility, any of these drinks can ensure a fun night!

            <img src=../project/corona.jpg alt="corona">
            <p>This drink has no relation to Covid-19 and only to Corona Extra beer. This is one of my go-to drinks that is always a crowd-pleaser. If you have tequila, orange juice, a bottle of Corona, and some limes you can make this drink! Perfect for a day on the beach or your night-time happy hour, anytime is a good time for a Corona. First, grab your Corona and take a nice long sip. Drink the beer until the level is even with the top of the label on the bottle. </p>

Add a splash of grenadine to make the Corona bottle completely full again. Garnish with a wedge of lime and enjoy! This super easy drink requires very few ingredients and always hits the spot. Happy drinking! </p>
