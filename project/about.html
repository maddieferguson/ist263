        <h1>Hi! I'm Maddie!</h1>
        <img src=../project/maddie.jpg>

            <p>Hi! I’m Maddie. I am a student at Syracuse University studying Technology and Business. I am so happy you are on my site. This is a blog of some of my favorite drink recipes and Syracuse Restaurants. Thanks for coming!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I’m Maddie. A student, at-home bartender, and restaurant reviewer… Or something like that! I like to try new things and make new fun drinks. I am from Cleveland, OH and I am currently living in Syracuse, NY where I attend Syracuse University. I am a third-year student slowly learning the best restaurants to try in Syracuse! I may not be a skilled bartender, but I like to pretend. Hopefully, you enjoy learning about new restaurants and drink recipes.
            </p>
            <p>Anyone can make my drink recipes. I am the worst cook ever! (I even manage to ruin Kraft Mac & Cheese.) Despite this, I can make any of the drink recipes you may find on this site. Also, because I lack cooking ability, I know some of the best places to get brunch or dinner in Syracuse, NY. I am always looking for new drink recipes to new restaurants to go to! If you think I am missing anything, contact me and let me know!
            </p>
