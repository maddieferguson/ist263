    <h2>CORONA SUNRISE</h2>

    <div class="imagesflex">
            <div>This drink has no relation to Covid-19 and only to Corona Extra beer. This is one of my go-to drinks that is always a crowd-pleaser. If you have tequila, orange juice, a bottle of Corona, and some limes you can make this drink! Perfect for a day on the beach or your night-time happy hour, anytime is a good time for a Corona.</div>

            <div><h3>How to Make a Corona Sunrise</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> First, grab your Corona and take a nice long sip. Drink the beer until the level is even with the top of the label on the bottle. </li>
                    <li> Next, grab your tequila and fill it up to about where the bottleâ€™s neck begins to narrow. Pour orange juice to the top of the bottle, leaving a little room for a splash of grenadine. </li>
                    <li> Add a splash of grenadine to make the Corona bottle completely full again. </li>
                    <li> Garnish with a wedge of lime and enjoy! This super easy drink requires very few ingredients and always hits the spot. Happy drinking! </li>
